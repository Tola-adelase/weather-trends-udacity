# weather-trends-udacity
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends of the nearest city where I live (London) to/with the overall global temperature trends. The objective(s) of this project is to create a visualization and note the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends of the nearest city where I live (London).
